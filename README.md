This is a grid-like structure I'm creating. I am aware I could have a better performance with a 2D array but I wanted to research generic classes, interfaces and and all kinds of abstraction.
The use of this will be for game development and because I know the maximum size of the grid will be around 20x20, Im hoping it wont affect performance on a significant level.
